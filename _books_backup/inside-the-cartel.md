    quote: "... a masterclass in tension. Inside the Cartel is many things: a true crime epic, a psychological case study, a blueprint for undercover operations and a portrait of a man at war with who he has become. But more than anything it is a chilling testimony to the terrifying, thankless work of those who live in moral gray areas, sacrificing everything for the safety of others."

    quote: "Inside the Cartel is proof that truth is always stranger than fiction. In the case of Martin Suarez's incredible career as an FBI agent, the truth includes being the first to infiltrate Columbian drug cartels and holding the record for the longest time spent undercover."
